now we will go back to our save partial_payment js, we will modify it to save both tubo & partial payment, 
Example: Date Pawned: Aug 10, 2025, Amount Pawned: 5,000.00 Interest Rate: 0.06
Add partial payment on Sept. 15, 2025, assuming without payment history (fresh pawn). 
Partial Amount – 1,000.00
Interest Amount – 600.00 (pawned_amount * interest_rate * mos.)
It will save in partial_payment the partial amount only
